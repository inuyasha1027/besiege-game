Besiege
=======
by Kyle Dhillon

May 2013 - present

Besiege is a single-player real-time strategy and conquest game, written in Java for desktop and Android.
Command a custom army in a fully automated procedurally generated world of rivaling factions and kingdoms.
Win battles and earn glory, conquer cities and castles, and declare yourself ruler of your very own faction.

Map:
Besiege's island map is procedurally generated for each playthrough, using Voronoi graphs, Delaunay triangulation,
and Perlin noise functions, in a Java based off the methods described here:
http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/
The map is populated with over 100 cities, castles and villages, hundreds of armies, and plenty for the player to explore.

AI:
Besiege's AI is fully-automated, meaning if left alone without player participation the world can run smoothly forever.
Rival factions will develop, kingdoms will fall and new ones will arise to take their place.

Day 63: fixed major bug that would call A* very frequently (armies would still follow garrisoned armies)

now (mostly engine issues):

bandits (possible all armies running) are adding a shit ton of things to their stack. fix this.

mostly solved!
big problem: heap is growing very fast with objects, then being garbage collected so all the objects go away. try to prevent this somehow. This isn't soldiers, because they're not created and destroyed. Must be some other problem. Pathfinding maybe. Growing up to using 200mb at max use. should be much lower. Shit ton of memory leaks beacuse garbage collection gets rid of a billion things.

Tried with no effect:
only one soldier per army
no creation of new sites in pathfinding (as if no borders)
commented out kingdom.act (WHAT THE F) char[] ncreasing to 40 mb, object 30
commented out addActor(kingdom) still increases to 200mb, but slowly
commented out addActor(sidePanel), static at 69mb (still too big!), 33mb of int
commented out new Kingdom, static at 30mb (mostly byte[], char[], int[])
commented out new(sidePanel), increases to 200mb quickly

might not be disposing properly, or cleaning spritebatch properly

tried removing army.act, bytes still increase  to 200mb but much slower now

implement army repairing based on wealth (?)
allow joining battles (?)
some armies just get "stuck" after battle - find out why (?)
armies can't garrison in their own towns sometimes
fix glitch where player can't move after winning battle
make bandits not seige (?)
add city garrison/wealth management
fix "economy"

later:

gameplay:
add resting - in cities and outside - for player and others.
implement "honor" and baronage for player
change "back" button to use a stack
add populations
add partyCap for nobles and player
fix " upgrade for flail not found!" (allow veteran upgrade)
make farmers not spawn immediately!
give names to each region (and village names will be the same), and castle names will be "____ castle" or "____ fortress" 

where should I put these? could put them on corners or centers, if corners, how to make sure they don't share names with a city or castle? 
use completely different names...? ok
Belvoir Castle
Belvoir Fortress
Belvoir Stronghold
Belvoir Ruins

engine:
also figure out why some things happen twice?
fix army following--path doesn't account for borders when chasing--should follow same path as party.
use shape renderer to draw map instead of drawing entire map (large) every time, see if improvements

optimizations:
use kd tree for towns, villages, and centers
improve battle mechanic! (don't just RNG every frame...)

map improvements:
fix visibility graph with penninsulas
add castles
add rivers (just more impassable edges--and check for in between corners)
utilize map areas (farmland = more wealth, mountains make you slow, etc?)

aesthetics:
add rain/lightning!
add cool loading screen 
consolidate battlePanel display using partyPanel's
smooth out camera centering
add minimap (use clipping?)
improve asthetics of map (add rough edges and noise/textures, roads, forests, other details)
test on android
add ruins

castles:
serve as military strongholds (better defense than most towns, more troops, not much economic benefit but important for territorial control. Spawns scouting parties.

final map goals: 
40 cities (or bigger!)
25 castles
10 factions (6 large, 4 small) and bandits
areas bandits spawn, bandit camps kinda like villages?
sphere of influence

inefficiencies:
army detect nearby (improved on day 50)
party check upgrade

adding edge noise: add noise to each Voronoi edge before drawing, making sure still hits endpoints and crosses Delaunay edge. Use Amit's recursive function in NoisyEdges.as
(can do this either just asthetically or actually break down every line into much smaller lines--probably slower pathfinding, etc but more natural)

Level/Tier info:
Tr  Lvl atk def spd
0   1   1   1   1   Farmer
1   3   1   1   2   Vet. Farmer
2   5   1   2   2   Militia
3   7   2   2   2   Vet. Militia
4   10  2   3   2   Tier 4 (spearman etc)
5   12  3   3   2   Tier 5 (vet spearman)
6   15  3   3   3   Tier 6 (pikeman)
7   18  3   4   3   Tier 7 (vet. pikeman)
8   22  4   4   3   Tier 8 (pikemaster)
9   25  4   4   4   Tier 9 (vet pikemaster)

World goal: 
The player inhabits a vast kingdom comprised of many factions of various sizes, each controlling
their own sets of locations including cities, castles and villages. Each faction is trying to maximize
their own influence and wealth by conquering more territory and trading. Factions at war develop bitter
rivalries, factions at peace forge uneasy alliances. Bandits and thieves raid trade routes and farmers, 
and rogue rebel factions occassionally arise. Noblemen command sizable parties to attack other factions
and defend their own, while bandit warlords can rise up to challenge them. 
(think about adding a "party level" as parties win more and more battles?)

AI goal: (requires a lot of 'tuning')
A full automated thriving economy exists, and the gameworld should be able to run without player
interaction for days without imbalance occurring. Powerful empires should fall given enough time,
and new ones should rise up to take their place. Factions, cities, and parties on average should 
have an average wealth that remains generally the same, with some getting very rich and some very poor.

Gameplay goal:
Begin by leading a ragtag band of soldiers, trying to gain wealth, fame, and power. 
As you, their leader, become more respected and capable, your party can grow stronger. By honing your party,
you can try taking on bigger and stronger targets, determining your relation with various factions.
Once strong enough, you can take your shot at capturing a city or town. Then you can create your own faction
and declare yourself as king. Other factions will take notice and may react violently, opening up opportunities
for more expansion or annihilation. You should be able to organize your own merchants, patrols, siege parties,
etc.

army types and purposes:

    Farmers - created at villages, farm to gather wealth for cities and villages
    (Village Patrol) - patrols around villages when they become wealthy enough
    
    Merchants - created at cities, trade between cities to gather wealth for cities
    Patrol - created at cities, patrol around cities when wealthy enough
    
    (Siege Party)
    (Travelers)
    (Pilgrims)
    (Monks)
    (Scouts)
    (Horsemen)
    (Barbarians)
    (Deserters)
    (Shepherds)
     Noblemen - fight each other, raid villages, and besiege cities
        (King) (150+?)
        Archduke
        Prince
        Duke (100+)
        Marquis (80-100)
        Earl (Count)(60-80)
        Baron (40-60)
        (Knights are not noble)
    
    Bandits - created randomly, attack farmers, patrols (raid villages?)
    (Raiders) - created randomly, attack farmers, patrols, and raid villages? 
    
    Gameplay:

control a party on the map. 
Party screen/window contains info about who is in your party, upgrades, etc.
Character screen/window contains player info.

tips:
use object pooling for Armies (allows reuse and efficient memory use)
when drawing background image, disable blending!
or perhaps scene2d makes the most sense for this type of game (actors and stage!)
^definitely makes the most sense (actions, draws all together, etc)

tuning up later:
    check maxSpritesInBatch (int) field of SpriteBatch after running the program and set max to that number
   
ideas:
    make battles 2d fights with rpg maker style characters
        more details: require separate engine, allow player to control units like rts, lay out on grid formation. cool idea
    make visits to cities 2d rpg maker style
    make a plot where you play as both the good guy and the bad king he's trying to defeat (through flashbacks to his rise to power) - focus on the moral dilemmas and parallelisms?
