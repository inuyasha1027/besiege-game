Besiege is a single-player real-time strategy and conquest game, written in Java for desktop and Android.
Command a custom army in a fully automated procedurally generated world of rivaling factions and kingdoms.
Win battles and earn glory, conquer cities and castles, and declare yourself ruler of your very own faction.

Map:
Besiege's island map is procedurally generated for each playthrough, using Voronoi graphs, Delaunay triangulation,
and Perlin noise functions, in a Java based off the methods described here:
http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/
The map is populated with over 100 cities, castles and villages, hundreds of armies, and plenty for the player to explore.

AI:
Besiege's AI is fully-automated, meaning if left alone without player participation the world can run smoothly forever.
Rival factions will develop, kingdoms will fall and new ones will arise to take their place.
